# Statistical_Data_Analysis-SDA-Project

Project description:
Working as an analyst for the telecom operator Megaline. The company offers its clients two prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate. 
The commercial department wants to know which of the plans brings in more revenue in order to adjust the advertising budget. 
Carry out a preliminary analysis of the plans based on a relatively small client selection. You'll have the data on 500 Megaline clients: who the clients are, where they're from, which plan they use, and the number of calls they made and text messages they sent in 2018. Your job is to analyze clients' behavior and determine which prepaid plan brings in more revenue. 

Description of the plans Note:
Megaline rounds seconds up to minutes, and megabytes to gigabytes. For calls, each individual call is rounded up: even if the call lasted just one second, it will be counted as one minute. For web traffic, individual web sessions are not rounded up. Instead, the total for the month is rounded up. If someone uses 1025 megabytes this month, they will be charged for 2 gigabytes.
