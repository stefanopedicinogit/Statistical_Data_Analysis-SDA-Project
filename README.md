# Statistical_Data_Analysis-SDA-Project

## Project description:
Working as an analyst for a telephonic company. The company offers its clients two prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate.\
The commercial department wants to know which of the plans brings in more revenue in order to adjust the advertising budget.\
Carry out a preliminary analysis of the plans based on a relatively small client selection. You'll have the data on 500 customers.\
Your job is to analyze clients' behavior and determine which prepaid plan brings in more revenue. 

## Guidelines:
Rounds seconds up to minutes, and megabytes to gigabytes. For calls, each individual call is rounded up: even if the call lasted just one second, it will be counted as one minute. For web traffic, individual web sessions are not rounded up. Instead, the total for the month is rounded up. If someone uses 1025 megabytes this month, they will be charged for 2 gigabytes.
